# Visualizing Job Outcomes of US College Graduates
In this project, we investigate a dataset on job outcomes of US college graduates from 2010 to 2012. The data and its documentation are available in the repo. Using visualization, we explore the answers to the following questions:

- Do students in more popular majors make more money?
- Do students in more popular majors have lower unemployment rate?
- Do students in majors that produce the most full-time employees have higher earning?
- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
